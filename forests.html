   <p>At the heart of the forest lived a family of deer. </p>
   <p>They were gentle creatures, always in harmony with the rhythm of nature.</p>
   <p>The father deer was proud and strong, his antlers a symbol of his authority.</p>
   <p>The mother deer was kind and nurturing, always tending to her fawns.</p>
   <p>And the fawns were playful and curious, always exploring their surroundings.</p>

<div class="repeated-text top">
<p>One day, while out foraging for food,</p>
<p> the fawns stumbled upon a beautiful meadow filled with wildflowers of every color.</p>
<p>They frolicked in the sunshine, chasing each other and nibbling on the sweet petals.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a fierce storm rolled in, bringing with it thunder and lightning.</p>
<p>The fawns were frightened and sought refuge in the safety of the nearby cave.</p>

<div class="repeated-text top">
<p>As they huddled together,</p>
<p> they were amazed to see the storm transformed into a magnificent display of colors and light. </p>
<p>The lightning lit up the sky, painting it with hues of pink, purple, and blue.</p>
<p>The thunder boomed, echoing through the mountains like the beating of a drum.</p>
<p> And the rain washed over the meadow,</p>
<p>washing away the dirt and leaving behind a carpet of vibrant flowers.</p>

<div class="repeated-text top">
<p>The fawns were in awe of the power of nature, </p>
<p>and they realized that even though the storm had frightened them, it was also a thing of beauty.</p>
<p>They promised to always remember the lesson they learned that day, </p>
<p>and to always be grateful for the wonders of the natural world.</p>

<div class="repeated-text top">
<p>And so, the fawns grew up to be strong and wise, </p>
<p> always appreciating the beauty of the world around them.</p>
<p>And the magical forest flourished, its wonders and magic never fading,</p>
<p> always inspiring awe and wonder in all who were lucky enough to experience it.</p>
